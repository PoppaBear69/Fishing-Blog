    <h1>Welcome to Thurman's Fishing Adventures</h1>
    <h2>Let me share my happy place!</h2>
    <p>Come join me while I take you along on some of my fishing adventures. My boat is docked near Smith point bridge. It's not far from Moritches Bay on the south shore of long Island. The most common fish caught in that area are Striped Bass, Blues and Porgies.</p>
